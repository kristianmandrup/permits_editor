== Permits Editor app

This app is a demo app for how to enable editing of Permissions config (yaml) files, used by *cancan-permits*.

URLs:
* localhost:3000/licenses
* localhost:3000/permits
* localhost:3000/user_permits

Config files:
* config/licenses.yaml
* config/permits.yaml
* config/user_permits.yaml

The goal is to make this editor work, then extract it into an engine as part of the *cancan-permits* gem :) 
*cancan-permits* already has some infrastructure that should let it load and apply the permits configuration from these config files.
