== Permits Editor app

This app is a demo app for how to enable editing of Permissions config (yaml) files, used by *cancan-permits*.

URLs:
* localhost:3000/licenses
* localhost:3000/permits
* localhost:3000/user_permits

Config files:
* config/licenses.yaml
* config/permits.yaml
* config/user_permits.yaml

Note: The public/javascripts/application.js should be updated with some jquery "magic", to have the page update when a new item is selected in the dropdown ;)
